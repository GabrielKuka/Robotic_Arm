# Robotic Arm

## This project was done in cooperation with my team: Robofultz

###**Team members:**

* Gabriel Kuka (Programmer)
* Sindy Kola (Designer)
* Kamber Vogli (Assistant)
* Devid Dermyshi (Assistant) (Team Leader)

**Time period: 15/11/2015 - 20/3/2016**

####**Description:**
The robotic arm is made in the laboratory of Harry T. Fultz Institute. It is a fully 3D printed device. The arm is a prototype of industrial robotic arms which improvises basic pre-programmed movements. It can be controlled with a smartphone device that runs Android OS or it can move independently to catch and release objects based on certain algorithmic patterns.
